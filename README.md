# Building Presentable Notebooks in Jupyter
A collection of tips, examples, and tools to make content in Jupyter easy to share with broad audiences. 

The `.ipynb` file is the source notebook with all the live code, visualizations, and other media. The `.html` export removes all the technical elements from the notebook so that it is purely presentation oriented. Finally, the `.pdf` export is meant to be a simple demonstration of what does (and does not) make the cut in purely static formats.

## Viewing Files

This repository is an imperfect place to view these files without downloading them first. The notebook can be viewed using nbviewer [HERE](https://nbviewer.org/github/styounessi/Jupyter_Notebook_Tips/blob/main/notebook_presentation.ipynb). The HTML file is best viewed by downloading it locally and opening it in a web browser. 

## Technologies Used
A list of everything used to make the notebook and the examples in each section.

## What's Next?
This project is really just a place to share all of the practical and useful things I've learned on my Jupyter journey so it should hopefully be updated over time as technologies change and I encounter and learn more helpful practices.
