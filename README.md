# Building Presentable Notebooks in Jupyter
A collection of tips, examples, and tools to make content in Jupyter easy to share with broad audiences. 

The `.ipynb` file is the source notebook with all the live code, visualizations, and other media. The `.html` export removes all the technical elements from the notebook so that it is a purely presentation oriented document. 

## Viewing Files

The notebook can be viewed using nbviewer [HERE](https://nbviewer.org/github/styounessi/jupyter_tips/blob/main/presentable_notebook_tips.ipynb). 

The HTML export version can be downloaded locally and viewed in any web browser. 

## Technologies Used
A list of everything used to make the notebook and the examples in each section.

## What's Next?
This project is really just a place to share all of the practical and useful things I've learned on my Jupyter journey so it should hopefully be updated over time as technologies change and I encounter and learn more helpful practices.
